Target: 10.10.8.116


From our nmap scan, I found 3 ports open

One of the port is 8009 running ajp13 which is the apache jserve protocol used to send reverse proxy to the backend application server. It has a file read vulnerability which allows an attacker to read the content of the ```WEB-INF/web.cml``` file on apache tomcat. I exploited this vulnerability using metasploit and I was able to get the credentials to login using ssh

Finding the first flag was easy, i just had to use the find command to search for it - ```find / -type f -name user.txt 2>/dev/null```

And this is where the main 'hacking' started hehe.

Listing our current directory, there is an encypted file with its key and trying to decrypt this file require a passphrase so I downloaded the file and the key to my own machine and used a johntheripper tool ```gpg2john``` to find and decrypt the passphrase

'Alexandru' is the passphrase to decrypt the file and back to the target machine. I imported the key on the target machine and tried to decrypt the file again with the passphrase and got the credentials for another user 'merlin'

I switched to the user and tried to gain root privilege. I used ```sudo -l``` to determine what commands I can run as a sudoer

I found a way to exploit this ```/usr/bin/zip``` binary in https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/zip/#sudo and escalated privileges to read the root flag. And voila!
